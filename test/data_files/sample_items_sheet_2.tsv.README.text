Note that one of the lines in file sample_items_sheet_2.tsv has two blank fields at end of line.
PyCharm and perhaps other editors "helpfully" removes trailing whitespace from lines,
so the number of columns varies line-to-line. Instead of insisting on explicit tabs at end of line,
we pad such short lines with nulls when reading from the file.
