    LICENSE_TITLE is a string naming the license to be expected in LICENSE.txt

    COPYRIGHT_OWNER is the name of the copyright owner.

    FRAMEWORKS will default to all defined frameworks (presently ['python', 'javascript'], but can be limited to
     just ['python'] for example.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to limit it to ['javascript'], though you could,
     since you are using a Python library to do this, and it probably needs to have its dependencies checked.

    ALLOWED is a list of license names as returned by the pip-licenses library.

    EXPECTED_MISSING is a list of libraries that are expected to have no license information. This is so you don't
      have to get warning fatigue by seeing a warning over and over for things you know about. If a new library
      with no license info shows up that you don't expect, you should investigate it, make sure it's OK,
      and then add it to this list.

    EXCEPTIONS is a table (a dict) keyed on license names with entries that are lists of library names that are
      allowed to use the indicated license even though the license might not be generally allowed. This should be
      used for license types that might require special consideration. For example, some uses may be OK in a dev-only
      situation like testing or documentation that are not OK in some other situation.

    Note that if you don't like these license names, which are admittedly non-standard and do nt seem to use
    SPDX naming conventions, you can customize the get_dependencies method to return a different
    list, one of the form
    [{"name": "libname", "license_classifier": ["license1", "license2", ...], "language": "python"}]
